Assignment 04

This directory includes source code for a linked list implementation
and a test client to test that linked list.

Provide your implementation for the 5 requested functions within LinkedList.h

You may use aClient.cpp to test your code.

Feel free to write extra test cases as you are working on them. But do not 
make any changes to aClient.cpp.



To compile aClient, run:
    make
To run: 
    ./listtest
To cleanup object files:
    make clean
